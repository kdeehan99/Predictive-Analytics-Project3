# Predictive-Analytics-Project3
This project takes a journey through a Goodreads dataset with a mission to develop an accurate recommendation system by using collaborative filtering methods.  After our team at Bookworms, LLC. thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, three models were built and evaluated: Model 1: User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF), Model 2: Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF), and Model 3: A Popularity-Based Model. The model performance was assessed
using the lowest RMSE and results from Top-N metrics precision/recall. Our team discovered that Item-Based Collaborative Filtering emerged victorious and was deemed the most effective model for personalized recommendations, as long as issues like data sparsity and cold-start problems are not present.
